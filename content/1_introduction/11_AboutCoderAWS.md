## Why Coder on AWS?

Coder delivers self-hosted cloud development environments (CDEs) that are provisioned as code and pre-deployed for both developer and agent activity from day one. It runs in your own AWS environment—or even in air-gapped setups when necessary—giving developers access to powerful infrastructure without compromising governance. With Coder, developers spend less time troubleshooting and more time coding, while infrastructure teams can standardize environments and eliminate the security and governance risks of local setups.

## Core Value Propositions

Coder CDEs deliver benefits in three key areas: developer productivity, enterprise-grade security, and cost optimization.

- **No Local Setup**: Developers access fully-configured, AI-ready environments in minutes, eliminating "works on my machine" issues with standardized workspaces
- **Code Protection**: Source code never leaves your AWS infrastructure with built-in compliance, audit trails, and network isolation within your secure VPC
- **Auto-Scaling**: Environments automatically start/stop and right-size resources based on usage, reducing costs by up to 70% through efficient shared infrastructure

## AI-Driven Development Advantages

Coder enables four key AI-enhanced workflows: intelligent code generation, automated quality assurance, accelerated learning, and collaborative AI experiences.

- **Context-Aware AI**: Amazon Kiro and Amazon Bedrock models leverage full project context in standardized environments for scalable, relevant code suggestions
- **Automated Reviews**: AI agents provide automated code reviews, documentation generation, and security scanning integrated into development workflows
- **Personalized Guidance**: AI assistants deliver contextual help and pattern recognition to accelerate new developer learning and knowledge transfer
- **Shared AI Context**: Teams benefit from collective AI interactions with consistent behavior and secure processing within AWS infrastructure

## Real-World Impact

Organizations using Coder on AWS report:
- **90% faster** developer onboarding (minutes vs. days)
- **70% reduction** in development infrastructure costs
- **Zero security incidents** related to local development environments
- **50% increase** in developer satisfaction scores

::alert[**Why Cloud Development Environments Matter**: Leading technology companies like Anthropic, Netflix, Goldman Sachs, and Government/Intelligence Agencices have adopted CDEs to scale their development teams efficiently while maintaining security and consistency. This workshop shows you how to implement the same patterns in your organization.]{type="info"}

## Template Architecture Patterns

### Infrastructure as Code Approach

All templates follow Terraform-based Infrastructure as Code principles:

```hcl
# Example template structure from the repository
terraform {
  required_providers {
    coder = {
      source = "coder/coder"
    }
    aws = {
      source = "hashicorp/aws"
    }
  }
}

# Workspace and owner data sources
data "coder_workspace" "me" {}
data "coder_workspace_owner" "me" {}

# AWS resources with proper tagging
resource "aws_instance" "workspace" {
  # Instance configuration
  tags = {
    Name = "coder-${data.coder_workspace_owner.me.name}-${data.coder_workspace.me.name}"
    Coder_Provisioned = "true"
  }
}
```

### Security Best Practices

The templates implement several security best practices:

- **IAM Integration**: Proper AWS IAM roles and policies
- **Resource Tagging**: Consistent tagging for resource management
- **Encryption**: EBS volume encryption by default
- **Access Control**: Workspace-level access controls

### Scalability Features

- **Auto-scaling**: Kubernetes-based templates support horizontal scaling of EKS Cluster Node Pools
- **Resource Optimization**: Right-sized instances for different workloads
- **Persistent Storage**: Separation of compute and storage for cost efficiency
- **Multi-region Support**: Templates work across AWS regions

## Template Management and Updates

Now that you've deployed the workshop templates, you can manage and update them using the same GitOps workflow:

### Updating Templates

To update templates with new features or configurations:

```bash
# In your template-admin-workspace
cd /workspaces/aws-coder-workshop-gitops/templates

# Make changes to template files
# Edit main.tf files in template directories

# Deploy updates
./templates_gitops.sh $CODER_SESSION_TOKEN
```

### Adding New Templates

To add organization-specific templates:

```bash
# Create new template directory
mkdir awshp-custom-template
cd awshp-custom-template

# Create template files
# Add main.tf, README.md, and other required files

# Update template_versions.tf to include new template
# Deploy changes
cd ..
./templates_gitops.sh $CODER_SESSION_TOKEN
```

## Next Steps

With persona-based templates deployed, you can:

1. **Create Workspaces**: Users can create workspaces from available templates
2. **Monitor Usage**: Track template usage and performance metrics
3. **Iterate Templates**: Update templates based on user feedback
4. **Scale Deployment**: Add more specialized templates as needed

The templates from the workshop repository provide a solid foundation for building a comprehensive development platform that serves multiple developer personas while maintaining consistency and security standards.

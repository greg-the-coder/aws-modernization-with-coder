## Building Intelligent Development Environments

Welcome to the Template Engineering module! Now that you have a fully deployed Coder platform on AWS, it's time to create the development environments that will transform your team's productivity. In this module, you'll learn to engineer sophisticated Coder templates that combine Infrastructure as Code principles with AI-powered development workflows.

### What We'll Accomplish

In this module, you will:

1. **Master Template Fundamentals** - Understand Coder template architecture, Terraform integration, and workspace lifecycle management
2. **Create Persona-Based Templates** - Build specialized environments for General, Serverless, Windows, and Agentic AI AWS development 
3. **Integrate AI Development Tools** - Configure Amazon Q Developer and Claude Code/Amazon Bedrock for intelligent code assistance
4. **Optimize for Scale** - Design templates for multi-tenant environments with cost optimization and resource governance

## Template Engineering Philosophy

Effective template engineering goes beyond simple environment provisioning. It's about creating **intelligent, self-configuring development environments** that:

- **Eliminate Setup Friction**: Developers get fully configured environments in minutes
- **Enforce Best Practices**: Security, compliance, and coding standards built-in by default
- **Adapt to Context**: Templates that understand project requirements and configure accordingly
- **Scale Intelligently**: Resource allocation that matches workload demands
- **Integrate AI Workflows**: Development assistance that understands your codebase and patterns

## Architecture Overview

Coder templates leverage several key AWS services and patterns:

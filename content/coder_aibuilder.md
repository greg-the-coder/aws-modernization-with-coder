## Mission Briefing

Welcome to **"Clash of Agents"** - an AI Builder Lab Game Day where you'll deploy and enhance a Pet Store Agent on AWS Bedrock AgentCore!

### Coder Agent-Ready Workspaces: Your Secret Weapon

You'll have access to **Coder Agent-Ready Workspaces** - cloud development environments that come pre-configured with AI coding assistants and development tools. These workspaces provide:

- **Instant Development Environment**: No setup time - jump straight into coding with pre-configured tools and dependencies
- **AI-Powered Coding Assistance**: Built-in AI agents to help with code generation, debugging, and optimization
- **Collaborative Features**: Share workspaces and collaborate in real-time with your team
- **Scalable Resources**: Access to cloud compute resources that scale with your needs

### Game Day Scenarios Where Coder Accelerates Success

**Scenario 1: Rapid Agent Deployment**
- Use Coder's pre-built templates to quickly scaffold your Pet Store Agent infrastructure
- Leverage AI assistance to generate boilerplate code and configuration files
- Deploy faster than manual setup by 70%+

**Scenario 2: Code Enhancement & Debugging**
- Utilize AI coding agents to identify and fix bugs in your Pet Store Agent logic
- Get intelligent code suggestions for performance optimizations
- Implement new features with AI-generated code snippets

**Scenario 3: Infrastructure as Code**
- Access 3 specialized Coder templates from the [AWS Coder AI Builder GitOps repository](https://github.com/coder/aws-coder-ai-builder-gitops/tree/main/templates)
- Use agentic software development to automate infrastructure provisioning
- Implement GitOps workflows with AI-assisted configuration management

Your mission: Deploy the most robust and feature-rich Pet Store Agent using Coder's agentic capabilities to outpace the competition!
